**Design Ex Machina** is a thesis project for the Bachelor in Design at the Faculty of Design and Art at the Free University of Bolzano. After researching classic programming and artificial intelligence applications to the design field in order to understand innovative design workflows, great attention was given to teaching methodologies in the field. This research took then the shape of a handbook and two workshops with high-school and university design students and finally of this website, in order to share the results of the research with as many people as possible. This project aims to be a manual that not only **greatly enrich and simplify designers workflows**, but that also **fights disinformation and misconceptions on Artificial Intelligence** in the design community.
