# Welcome to Design Ex Machina

**Design Ex Machina** is an open-source platform designed to empower designers through programming and AI, realized as a bachelor thesis project at the **Free University of Bolzano's Faculty of Design and Art**.
Whether novice or inquisitive designer wanting to extend your toolkit, this site is an interactive introduction to algorithmic thinking and p5.js, guiding you from pseudocode to interactive, AI-enhanced design prototypes.
