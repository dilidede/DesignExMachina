# Welcome to Design Ex Machina

**Design Ex Machina** is a thesis project for the Bachelor in Design at the Faculty of Design and Art at the Free University of Bolzano. After researching classic programming and artificial intelligence applications to the design field in order to understand innovative design workflows, great attention was given to teaching methodologies in the field. This research took then the shape of a handbook and two workshops with high-school and university design students and finally of this website, in order to share the results of the research with as many people as possible. This project aims to be a manual that not only **greatly enrich and simplify designers workflows**, but that also **fights disinformation and misconceptions on Artificial Intelligence** in the design community.

## The Project

Every designer has been in the position of doing a task that was far too repetitive, and ended up wondering how they could have simplified and speeded up the process. Then again, as John Frazer precociously put it in 1995, one might have found themselves in “distorting the design process to fit the limitations of the most available program”, and this manual provides exactly the means to overcome these limitations and, in a certain way, to **revolutionarise the whole workflow**.

This ambitious aim will be achieved through teaching some basic knowledge on the importance of **algorithms** in our work, mainly in two form: **programming** and **artificial intelligence**. This manual doesn't claim to be able to teach everything on **creative coding** or how an **image generating model** works, but it can explain to everyone just enough to be **more autonomous** and to have a better grasp of the **everchanging world we live in**.

At first, we will learn about the basics of **p5js** programming, a sort of simplified design-focused version of JavaScript, then elements of about how machine learning works. Finally, these tools will be compared and merged in order to learn how to write code well beyond our capabilities, while still understanding what is happening in front of you. **This manual won't magically make you a professional computer scientist** and it does not aim to do so, but still, knowing how to program and how do these tools work will make it easier to work with one.

Furthermore, and this may be the **most important gain** from this manual, it will grant **independence** and **speed** to any designer.

## How to use this manual

It's not required to follow the section order we propose and it's completely possible to approach single chapters alone, anyway it would still be advisable to do so if you aim to follow the whole manual. If instead you come here already with some knowledge, it
